   *Qualification Round(Problem 2 Tidy Numbers)*
       
    For C++
      After you run the command "g++ -std=c++11 tidy_numbers.cpp" and the executable file is a.out
      Now after you compile you run ./a.out <inputFileName >outputFileName and you will have all the output in a file
  
    For Python 3
      You do not need to compile anything,you just have to pass the output in a file.
      Specifically you run the command "python 3 tidy_numbers.py >outputFileName" like in C++ but without compiling
